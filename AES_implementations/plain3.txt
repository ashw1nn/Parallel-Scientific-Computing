The idea of an asymmetric public-private key cryptosystem is attributed to Whitfield Diffie
 and Martin Hellman, who published this concept in 1976. They also introduced digital signatures
 and attempted to apply number theory.
Their formulation used a shared-secret-key created from exponentiation of some number, modulo a prime number.
However, they left open the problem of realizing
a one-way function, possibly because the difficulty of 
factoring was not well-studied at the time.
[4] Moreover, like Diffie-Hellman, RSA is based on modular exponentiation.

Figure 3 shows the architecture of the generator G,
which 
retains different levels of context states
with a hierarchy constructed by a paragraph RNN, a sen-
tence RNN, and a word RNN, and two attention modules.
First, the RNN encodes the current paragraph
state based on all preceding sentences. Second, the spa-
tial visual attention module selectively focuses on semantic
regions with the guidance of current paragraph state to pro-
duce the visual representation of the sentence. The sentence
RNN is thus able to encode a topic vector for the new sen-
tence. Third, the language attention module learns to incor-
porate linguistic knowledge embedded in local phrases of
focused semantic regions to facilitate word generation by
the word RN
